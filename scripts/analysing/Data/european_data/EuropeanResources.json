These concepts are fuzzy,\r\n since amateurs engage in research, researchers group themselves in \r\nmediator clusters and, as members of a community, we all become policy \r\nmakers albeit using a language different from their.\r\n\r\nIn the past two years, we mapped ongoing activities, institutions, \r\nfunding programs and initiatives as a first step in deciding the way in \r\nwhich to improve citizen engagement in science.  Once we analysed \r\nemerging trends and exemplary cases of citizen engagement in research \r\nprocesses and sciencerelated policy making, we proceeded to gather \r\ncollective knowledge, involving experts and amateurs alike.  To raise \r\nawareness and encourage the uptake of these ICT-enabled, open and social\r\n scientific practices, we consistently applied the concept of trusted \r\ncollaboration at all levels.  We encountered a heterogeneous landscape \r\nmade up of complex multi-actor, multi-level, transdisciplinary \r\ncommunities.  The initial findings were published in the Green Paper and\r\n subsequently refined, endorsed and supplemented by findings from a \r\nbroad consultation process and published in the present White Paper.  \r\nWhen providing policy recommendations, we attempted to strike a proper \r\nbalance between the different alternatives  by addressing several issues\r\n and stakeholders at the same time and by paying special attention to \r\nthe openness and emergence of this innovative approach to science.</p>","image1":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-03-24_020203034242_831_beeld-uit-the-white-paper-on-citizen-science-in-europe.jpg","image2":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-03-24_020203034242_797_beeld-uit-the-white-paper-on-citizen-science-in-europe.jpg","authors":[{"id":20,"author":"Socientize project"}],"audience":[{"id":7,"audience":"ALL Audiences"}],"dateUploaded":"2020-03-24T02:51:42.811517Z","keywords":[{"id":118,"keyword":"White Paper"},{"id":119,"keyword":"Europe"}],"category":{"id":8,"text":"Service","parent":null},"license":"Creative Commons CC-BY","publisher":"Socientize Project","datePublished":2014,"theme":[{"id":1,"theme":"Introduction to CS"},{"id":5,"theme":"Engagement"},{"id":6,"theme":"Co-creation"},{"id":7,"theme":"Communication"},{"id":10,"theme":"Empowerment"},{"id":14,"theme":"Regulations and ethics"},{"id":15,"theme":"Impact"}],"inLanguage":"en","resourceDOI":"","featured":false},{"id":138,"name":"Biodiversa Citizen Science Toolkit","url":"https://www.biodiversa.org/1814","abstract":"Discover the BiodivERsA Citizen Science Toolkit aimed at researchers and scientists working in the fields of biodiversity or environmental sciences who are involved or have an interest in involving citizens in their research projects.","image1":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-11-23_080811111414_200_logo.png","image2":null,"authors":[{"id":4,"author":"H Roy"},{"id":1704,"author":"L Goudeseune"},{"id":1705,"author":"H Eggermont"},{"id":1706,"author":"Q Groom"},{"id":1707,"author":"X Le Roux"},{"id":1708,"author":"C Paleco"},{"id":1709,"author":"C van Noordwijk"}],"audience":[{"id":1,"audience":"Researchers & Academics"}],"dateUploaded":"2020-11-23T08:36:14.851465Z","keywords":[],"category":{"id":5,"text":"Interactive Resource (Website)","parent":null},"license":"","publisher":"Biodiversa","datePublished":2020,"theme":[{"id":1,"theme":"Introduction to CS"},{"id":2,"theme":"Best practices"},{"id":12,"theme":"Instructions"}],"inLanguage":"en","resourceDOI":"","featured":false},{"id":18,"name":"Tree Tools for Schools","url":"http://www.treetoolsforschools.org.uk/categorymenu/?cat=activities","abstract":"<p>A collection of interactive activities, spotting sheets and downloadable\r\n resources for engaging children with the environment, especially \r\ntargetted at the classroom and school environment.</p>","image1":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-03-24_040403034343_729_Captura%20de%20pantalla%20de%202020-03-24%2005-03-53.png","image2":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-03-24_040403034343_144_Captura%20de%20pantalla%20de%202020-03-24%2005-03-53.png","authors":[{"id":46,"author":"Woodland Trust"},{"id":47,"author":"DEFRA"}],"audience":[{"id":2,"audience":"Educators"}],"dateUploaded":"2020-03-24T04:04:43.938100Z","keywords":[{"id":33,"keyword":"Education"},{"id":41,"keyword":"Activity"},{"id":42,"keyword":"Downloadable"}],"category":{"id":3,"text":"Event","parent":null},"license":"","publisher":null,"datePublished":2020,"theme":[{"id":12,"theme":"Instructions"},{"id":13,"theme":"Link with formal education"}],"inLanguage":"en","resourceDOI":"","featured":false},{"id":1,"name":"Citizen Science  science for everyone: A guide for teachers and support providers","url":"https://www.tcv.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/teacher_citizen_science_guide.pdf","abstract":"<p>This guide is a toolkit to help teachers build Citizen Science into their lessons and other school activities.

Reliable, timely, comprehensive, and consistent data are critical for measuring progress towards, and ultimately achieving, the SDGs. Data from citizen science represent one new source of data that could be used for SDG reporting and monitoring. However, information is still lacking regarding the current and potential contributions of citizen science to the SDG indicator framework. Through a systematic review of the metadata and work plans of the 244 SDG indicators, as well as the identification of past and ongoing citizen science initiatives that could directly or indirectly provide data for these indicators, this paper presents an overview of where citizen science is already contributing and could contribute data to the SDG indicator framework. The results demonstrate that citizen science is “already contributing” to the monitoring of 5 SDG indicators, and that citizen science “could contribute” to 76 indicators, which, together, equates to around 33%. Our analysis also shows that the greatest inputs from citizen science to the SDG framework relate to SDG 15 Life on Land, SDG 11 Sustainable Cities and Communities, SDG 3 Good Health and Wellbeing, and SDG 6 Clean Water and Sanitation. Realizing the full potential of citizen science requires demonstrating its value in the global data ecosystem, building partnerships around citizen science data to accelerate SDG progress, and leveraging investments to enhance its use and impact.","image1":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-07-09_010107074242_909_Fraisl%20et%20al%202020.jpg","image2":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-09-09_121209095959_892_un-sdgs-2018_.png","authors":[{"id":273,"author":"D Fraisl"},{"id":287,"author":"M Gold"},{"id":295,"author":"U Wehn"},{"id":299,"author":"J Campbell"},{"id":300,"author":"L See"},{"id":301,"author":"J Wardlaw"},{"id":302,"author":"I Moorthy"},{"id":303,"author":"R Arias"},{"id":304,"author":"J Piera"},{"id":305,"author":"J Oliver"},{"id":306,"author":"J Maso"},{"id":307,"author":"M Penker"},{"id":308,"author":"S Fritz"}],"audience":[{"id":7,"audience":"ALL Audiences"}],"dateUploaded":"2020-07-09T13:53:42.147332Z","keywords":[{"id":94,"keyword":"Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)"}],"category":{"id":6,"text":"Moving Image (Video)","parent":null},"license":"OA","publisher":"Sustainability Science, Springer","datePublished":2020,"theme":[{"id":2,"theme":"Best practices"},{"id":9,"theme":"CS stories"},{"id":11,"theme":"Data quality and standards"},{"id":15,"theme":"Impact"}],"inLanguage":"en","resourceDOI":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-020-00833-7","featured":false},{"id":134,"name":"Together towards a strategy for citizen science in Germany","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJkSmAgvQOs","abstract":"Film about process of developing the Green Paper Citizen Science Strategy 2020 for Germany","image1":null,"image2":null,"authors":[{"id":61,"author":"Anett Richter"},{"id":310,"author":"A Bonn"}],"audience":[{"id":7,"audience":"ALL Audiences"}],"dateUploaded":"2020-09-26T18:30:41.307626Z","keywords":[],"category":{"id":6,"text":"Moving Image (Video)","parent":null},"license":"CC-BY","publisher":"Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research- UFZ","datePublished":2016,"theme":[{"id":6,"theme":"Co-creation"}],"inLanguage":"en","resourceDOI":"","featured":false},{"id":38,"name":"Sapelli - data collection for non-literate participants","url":"http://www.sapelli.org/","abstract":"\"Sapelli is an open-source project that facilitates data collection across language or literacy barriers through highly configurable icon-driven user interfaces.

OdourCollect is the name of a Spanish citizen science project on odour pollution, run by Ibercivis Foundation with collaboration of Spanish Foundation on Science and Technology (FECYT). Students and teachers from educational centres can participate, together with their families, neighbourhoods and those who want to join in, as environmental researchers to monitor odours in the surrounding area or in their city. The guide includes a section for teachers and a section for students. Theoretical content is included on the topics: 1. What smell is and how smell works. 2. What is called odour pollution. 3. What is citizen science and its scientific methodology participatory. Along with various activities related to the above concepts, indications on how to use the OdourCollect app to map odours are included. The experimental part is based on the voluntary collective sensing by any person with a certain scientific, environmental, social or ethical-political interest, especially those citizens who suffer from odour pollution. Citizen scientists -in this case students and members of the school community- make the odour observations through the OdourCollect App and add them to the platform at any time and place, following the proposed methodology and making the data accessible for study by professional scientists and scientific citizens, and any interested group. Each contribution made will contribute to the construction of a collaborative international map which is already underway, as part of the D-NOSES project (dnoses.eu). This project, of three years in duration (2018-2021) and financed by the Commission&#39;s Horizon 2020 programme It has 14 partners from 9 countries and has already started work on 10 case studies in affected communities internationally.</p>\r\n","image1":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-03-25_030303034747_285_xportada_UNIDAD_DIDACTICA.png.pagespeed.ic.tNlzl6GpKz.webp.png","image2":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-03-25_030303034747_215_xportada_UNIDAD_DIDACTICA.png.pagespeed.ic.tNlzl6GpKz.webp.png","authors":[{"id":25,"author":"Miguel Ángel Queiruga Dios"},{"id":28,"author":"Daniel Lisbona Rubira"},{"id":151,"author":"Rosa Arias Álvarez"},{"id":152,"author":"Maite Pelacho López"}],"audience":[{"id":5,"audience":"CSOs & NGOs"},{"id":2,"audience":"Educators"},{"id":3,"audience":"Community Members & Citizens"}],"dateUploaded":"2020-03-25T15:25:47.371410Z","keywords":[{"id":71,"keyword":"OdourCollect"},{"id":72,"keyword":"odour pollution"},{"id":73,"keyword":"collective sensing"},{"id":74,"keyword":"app"},{"id":75,"keyword":"DNOSES"},{"id":76,"keyword":"map"},{"id":77,"keyword":"high school"},{"id":78,"keyword":"non formal education"}],"category":{"id":15,"text":"Guideline","parent":12},"license":"CC BY-SA 3.0 ES","publisher":"Editorial Q","datePublished":2019,"theme":[{"id":6,"theme":"Co-creation"},{"id":10,"theme":"Empowerment"},{"id":11,"theme":"Data quality and standards"},{"id":12,"theme":"Instructions"},{"id":13,"theme":"Link with formal education"},{"id":14,"theme":"Regulations and ethics"},{"id":15,"theme":"Impact"}],"inLanguage":"es","resourceDOI":"ISBN: 978-84-15575-10-8","featured":false},{"id":36,"name":"Living Knowledge Toolbox","url":"https://www.livingknowledge.org/resources/toolbox/","abstract":"This toolbox service will empower new Science Shops and people working in community based research in developing professional standards and enable existing Science Shops to refine and improve their practice through professional know-how.

This provides new opportunities for widening participation in scientific research and policy, thus opening a myriad of avenues driving a paradigm shift across fields and disciplines, including the strengthening of Citizen Science. Nowadays, the application of Citizen Science principles spans across several scientific disciplines, covering different geographical scales. While the interdisciplinary approach taken so far has shown significant results and findings, the current situation depicts a wide range of projects that are heavily context-dependent and where the learning outcomes of pilots are very much situated within the specific areas in which these projects are implemented. There is little evidence on how to foster the spread and scalability in Citizen Science. Furthermore, the Citizen Science community currently lacks a general agreement on what these terms mean, entail and how these can be approached. To address these issues, we developed a theoretically grounded framework to unbundle the meaning of scaling and spreading in Citizen Science. In this framework, we defined nine constructs that represent the enablers of these complex phenomena. We then validated, enriched, and instantiated this framework through four qualitative case studies of, diverse, successful examples of scaling and spreading in Citizen Science. The framework and the rich experiences allow formulating four theoretically and empirically grounded scaling scenarios. We propose the framework and the in-depth case studies as the main contribution from this report. We hope to stimulate future research to further refine our understanding of the important, complex and multifaceted phenomena of scaling and spreading in Citizen Science. The framework also proposes a structured mindset for practitioners that either want to ideate and start a new Citizen Science intervention that is scalable-by-design, or for those that are interested in assessing the scalability potential of an existing initiative.","image1":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-11-24_020211114848_880_IfC_sensors.jpg","image2":null,"authors":[{"id":1,"author":"The Conservation Volunteers"},{"id":238,"author":" C Nold"},{"id":239,"author":" D Dörler"},{"id":240,"author":" Daniel"},{"id":241,"author":" D Fraisl"},{"id":242,"author":" D Riemenschneider"},{"id":243,"author":" F Heigl"},{"id":244,"author":" Florian"},{"id":245,"author":" F Brounéus"},{"id":246,"author":" G Hager"},{"id":247,"author":" K Heuer"},{"id":248,"author":" K Wagenknecht"},{"id":249,"author":" K Vohland"},{"id":250,"author":" L Shanley"},{"id":251,"author":" L Deveaux"},{"id":252,"author":" Lionel"},{"id":253,"author":" L Ceccaroni"},{"id":254,"author":" M Weißpflug"},{"id":255,"author":" M Gold"},{"id":256,"author":" M Mazzonetto"},{"id":257,"author":" M Mačiulienė"},{"id":258,"author":" S Woods"},{"id":259,"author":" S Luna"},{"id":260,"author":" S Hecker"},{"id":261,"author":" T Schaefer"},{"id":262,"author":" T Woods"},{"id":263,"author":" U Wehn"},{"id":311,"author":" J Tweddle"},{"id":312,"author":" L Robinson"},{"id":313,"author":" H Roy"},{"id":314,"author":" M Pocock"},{"id":315,"author":" Vincia Holloman"},{"id":316,"author":" iNaturalist"},{"id":317,"author":" Fermin Serrano"},{"id":318,"author":" Jesús Clemente"},{"id":319,"author":" Mari Carmen Ibañez"},{"id":320,"author":" Francisco Sanz"},{"id":321,"author":" Alfonso Tarancón"},{"id":322,"author":" Laude Guardia"},{"id":323,"author":" David Iñiguez"},{"id":324,"author":" Alejandro Rivero"},{"id":325,"author":" Gonzalo Ruiz"},{"id":326,"author":" Alfredo Ferrer"},{"id":327,"author":" Maite Pelacho"},{"id":328,"author":" Pilar Perla"},{"id":329,"author":" Socientize project"},{"id":330,"author":" Lucía García Sánchez"},{"id":331,"author":" Alejandro Sánchez de Miguel"},{"id":332,"author":" María Diez Ojeda"},{"id":333,"author":" Ayla Márcia Cordeiro Bizerra"},{"id":334,"author":" Miguel Ángel Queiruga Dios"},{"id":335,"author":" Daniel Bruno Collados"},{"id":336,"author":" Mari Carmen Ibáñez Hernández"},{"id":337,"author":" Daniel Lisbona Rubira"},{"id":338,"author":" Anne Turbé"},{"id":339,"author":" Jorge Barba"},{"id":340,"author":" Chrisa Tsinaraki"},{"id":341,"author":" Shailendra Mudgal"},{"id":342,"author":" Lucy D.

The study was carried out by the French company Bio \r\nInnovation Service, together with the Ibercivis Foundation and the \r\nNatural History Museum in London.\r\nThe report defines citizen science as the non-professional participation\r\n of volunteers in the scientific process, either in the data collection \r\nstage or in other phases of research, and refers to its important \r\npotential as a source of relevant information to define environmental \r\npolicies and to meet the growing social demands for more participatory \r\ndecision-making. The aim of the research was to understand whether \r\ncitizen science projects in environmental matters, together with their \r\nscientific and social objectives, are indeed significantly supportive of\r\n environmental policies.\r\n</p><p>To this end, the first objective was to draw up an inventory of citizen \r\nscience projects of interest to environmental policy and to assess how \r\nthey contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDAs) established \r\nby the United Nations (UN) General Assembly. To this end, 503 projects \r\nwere identified through desk research and an EU-wide survey. The second \r\nobjective was to assess the conditions under which citizen's science can\r\n best support such policies, by further analysing a selection of 45 \r\nprojects through the study of 94 characteristics.</p><p>\r\nThe analysis shows that there are models relevant to environmental \r\npolicy, characterised by a diversity of partnerships and approaches to \r\ncommunity sustainability, data infrastructures and funding. Although \r\nmost of the projects surveyed are medium-sized and NGO-led, there are \r\nalso projects funded by the EU or national governments and led by \r\nacademia. Of the 45 projects analysed in depth, 32 (71%) effectively \r\ninfluence one or more environmental policies, such as problem \r\ndefinition, early warning or compliance with directives, among others. \r\nThe analysis provides a series of recommendations to enhance the \r\ncontribution of citizen science to environmental policy.</p>","image1":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-03-24_030303035858_658_Captura%20de%20pantalla%20de%202020-03-24%2004-26-34.png","image2":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-03-24_030303035858_612_Captura%20de%20pantalla%20de%202020-03-24%2004-26-34.png","authors":[{"id":8,"author":"Fermin Serrano"},{"id":11,"author":"Francisco Sanz"},{"id":18,"author":"Maite Pelacho"},{"id":29,"author":"Anne Turbé"},{"id":30,"author":"Jorge Barba"},{"id":32,"author":"Shailendra Mudgal"},{"id":33,"author":"Lucy D.

This set, although still incomplete, gives an idea of the multitude of initiatives that exist in Spain. The impact of citizen science on publications continues to grow globally and in Spain, with a sustained and notable increase in decentralized development, which reinforces the idea of methodology applicable to various disciplines. The impacts are also educational, social and economic, such as show the observatory&#39;s own data and other sources of information such as interviews with experts or the open work. The project co-financed by the FECYT has served to promote coordination between citizen science in Spain. Mailing lists have been set up, popular articles are published weekly (over 60) and 8 #citscichates have been organised this year. The portal brings together resources of public utility, including information, guides and resources. It serves as a showcase for all the experiments, developers, researchers and other facilitators of citizen science in Spain. The 2016 Report was welcomed by many communities.

Have you perceived nice or bad smells in your neighbourhood? Are you affected by odour pollution? We have the best sensor to identify and measure odours, our sense of smell!\r\n\r\nUse the power of your nose: Smell and share!\r\n\r\nOdourCollect is a free App that any citizen can use to report odours. It can be used as a citizen science experiment to build odour maps collaboratively based on odour observations, anywhere, anytime. Feel free to map any odour that you perceive, either nice or foul!\r\n\r\nThe app can also be used to report bad odours in affected communities by odour nuisance with the aim of co-creating solutions with all the stakeholders involved (citizens, industries, local authorities, citizen scientists and odour experts) to improve the quality of life of a community. Frequent exposure to annoying odours can cause headache, stress, anxiety, lack of concentration, insomnia or even increase respiratory problems. Even though ambient odours are the second cause of environmental complaints after noise worldwide, in many places there is no specific regulation to control the problem, meaning that there is no legal framework to protect citizens!\r\n\r\nOdourCollect is a tool to empower communities affected by odour nuisance, reporting it to the world! The odour observations will be validated by citizen science and odour experts to gather data in a particular area where a community is suffering from the problem with the aim of co-designing local solutions with the relevant stakeholders.\r\n\r\nThanks for participating in this citizen science experiment, helping us to build up collaborative odour maps!\r\n\r\nOdourCollect is inspired by a standardized European methodology to evaluate odour episodes through trained citizens' observations: the German standard VDI 3940:2006 (Measurement of odour impact by field inspection. Measurement of the impact frequency of recognizable odours - Grid measurement), which has become in the European standard CEN 16841. Although the standard defines a strict methodology to measure odours (odour observations are to be gathered during a certain time - typically one year - in a specific area and are performed by certified standard human “noses” or observers), OdourCollect adapts the methodology to gather real-time data on odour perception anywhere, anytime, by any citizen. Our methodology is under validation in 10 pilot projects all around the globe, and we aim to develop a new standard to be replicated worldwide.\r\n\r\nOdourCollect is an idea of Science for Change. This app has been developed thanks to the D-NOSES Project (Distributed Network for Odour Sensing, Empowerment and Sustainability).\r\n\r\nYou can download the app for free on the Google Play Store or the iOS App Store, or use the web-based version under https://odourcollect.eu. The App is available in English, Spanish, Catalan, Portuguese, German, Italian and Greek.","image1":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-08-04_010108085050_382_OdourCollect_Logo.png","image2":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-08-04_010108085050_685_Nora_OdourCollect_Photo.jpg","authors":[],"audience":[{"id":7,"audience":"ALL Audiences"}],"dateUploaded":"2020-08-04T13:35:50.927092Z","keywords":[],"category":{"id":1,"text":"Collection","parent":null},"license":"","publisher":"Science for Change","datePublished":2018,"theme":[{"id":4,"theme":"Research design and methods"},{"id":5,"theme":"Engagement"},{"id":10,"theme":"Empowerment"}],"inLanguage":"en","resourceDOI":"","featured":false},{"id":79,"name":"Wikidata","url":"https://www.wikidata.org","abstract":"Wikidata is a multilingual free knowledge base of structured data.

Viele Institutionen, welche in Citizen Science aktiv sind, haben sich 2017 auf Initiative der Plattform Österreich forscht im Citizen Science Network Austria zusammengeschlossen und sich damit dazu bekannt, die Qualität von Citizen Science in Österreich zu fördern. Ein wichtiger Schritt zur Förderung dieser Qualität war es, transparente Kriterien aufzustellen, die jene Projekte erfüllen müssen, welche auf der Plattform Österreich forscht gelistet werden möchten. Das Ziel dieser Kriterien ist, die Qualität der auf der Plattform vorgestellten Projekte weiter hochzuhalten und noch zu steigern. Die Ausarbeitung erfolgte in mehreren Schritten, wobei zusätzlich zum Wissen der Arbeitsgruppenmitglieder auch mehrmals Feedback von externen Expertinnen und Experten aus den jeweiligen Fachbereichen eingearbeitet wurde. Um auch das Wissen der Bevölkerung in die Kriterien einfließen lassen zu können, wurde über den gesamten Oktober 2017 hinweg ein Entwurf der Qualitätskriterien für eine öffentliche Onlinekonsultation auf der Plattform Österreich forscht freigegeben. Mit diesem Datum haben die Qualitätskriterien ihre Gültigkeit erlangt. Bereits gelistete Projekte auf Österreich forscht haben die Möglichkeit, sich den Kriterien innerhalb eines Jahres anzupassen. Projekte, welche neu auf Österreich forscht gelistet werden möchten, müssen diese Kriterien bei Listung erfüllen. Die Qualitätskriterien werden zukünftig nach Bedarf adaptiert, um neuen Herausforderungen und Entwicklungen gerecht zu werden. Die Versionsnummer der Kriterien, welcher ein Projekt entspricht, wird auf der jeweiligen Projektseite angegeben. Der erste Teil der Kriterien dient vor allem der Feststellung, was ein Citizen Science Projekt ausmacht. Hier haben wir uns zu einer Negativliste entschlossen , um die Plattform möglichst offen für unterschiedliche Konzepte, Herangehensweisen und Disziplinen zu halten. Dies bedeutet, dass wir alle Projekte, welche nicht durch diese Kriterien ausgeschlossen werden als Citizen Science Projekte verstehen. Der professionelle Hintergrund der Person, welche die Projektleitung übernimmt, ist nicht ausschlaggebend, solange die Kriterien vom Projekt selbst erfüllt werden. Die Kriterien im zweiten Teil sind als Mindeststandards zu verstehen, welche alle Projekte auf Österreich forscht erfüllen müssen. Die Evaluierung erfolgt durch die Koordinatorinnen und Koordinatoren der Plattform Österreich forscht unter Beratung von Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeitern der Arbeitsgruppe.","image1":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-03-31_080803032929_180_ee760d1c1474fde7f8f71a96b2452e29_L.jpg","image2":null,"authors":[],"audience":[{"id":1,"audience":"Researchers & Academics"},{"id":5,"audience":"CSOs & NGOs"},{"id":6,"audience":"Policy & Decision Makers"},{"id":4,"audience":"CS Project Leaders & Initiators"},{"id":3,"audience":"Community Members & Citizens"}],"dateUploaded":"2020-03-31T08:07:29.172972Z","keywords":[],"category":{"id":15,"text":"Guideline","parent":12},"license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode","publisher":"Pamela Bartar, Robert Brodschneider, Marika Cieslinski, Marlene Ernst,  Steffen Fritz, Irmgard Kri","datePublished":2018,"theme":[{"id":16,"theme":"Evaluation of citizen science"},{"id":5,"theme":"Engagement"},{"id":2,"theme":"Best practices"},{"id":12,"theme":"Instructions"},{"id":17,"theme":"Project sustainability"},{"id":4,"theme":"Research design and methods"},{"id":14,"theme":"Regulations and ethics"},{"id":7,"theme":"Communication"},{"id":3,"theme":"Project management"}],"inLanguage":"de","resourceDOI":"  10.31219/osf.io/89cqj","featured":false},{"id":45,"name":"Citizen science – új módszertan?","url":"http://www.replika.hu/system/files/archivum/replika_99-06_mund.pdf","abstract":"Most of our scientific knowledge originates from respected representatives of scientific research. We believe them because the scientific community, rigorous scientific education and strict methodology seem to guarantee their reliability. However, a new methodological trend has appeared in natural sciences in recent years referred to as ”Citizen Science”. It signifies scientific research that is altogether or in parts conducted by amateur or nonprofessional scientists. Citizen science is sometimes described as “public participation in scientific research”. The first article evaluating the results of a research conducted with this methodolody appeared in Ethology in September 2015. Dog owners could register to participate in the research on the website “dognition.com”. Half of the dog owners even paid for participating in the tests, so they not only supported the research by collecting data but also with money. In exchange they received an evaluation of the performance of their dogs. If dog owners can do the testing reliably, this opens new perspectives in ethological research.

It has long been known that those who are pursuing studies in higher education tend to live longer, spend more years in health, have a higher lifetime earning rate and be more active citizens - and we could further list the individual and social benefits of higher education. However, the increasing number of tertiary graduates also has a very positive side effect - something that scientific forums in Hungary have scarcely mentioned. This is the erosion of the knowledge monopoly and the democratisation of science. That is, the increasing role of amateurs and laymen in scientific research.

However, to date, contributions of citizen science to environmental decision-making remain sparse and not well understood. Evidence points to a gap between the potential relevance of citizen science for policy and its actual implementation. We lack a comprehensive assessment of the current impacts of citizen science projects on environmental policy, and an identification of the scientific, engagement, and governance characteristics of projects that facilitate successful contributions to policy. This paper addresses that knowledge gap through identifying the characteristics of citizen science projects that support policy. We present an inventory of 503 citizen science projects with environmental policy relevance, and an in-depth analysis of 45 case examples with quantitative assessment of characteristics of the citizen scientist, scientific, socio-economic, and policy dimensions. Our results demonstrate that citizen science can underpin all steps of the environmental policy process, and that a diversity of approaches can be used to achieve this. However, governmental support, scientific excellence, and NGO-leadership facilitate policy linkages. We discuss the main challenges and opportunities identified by project leaders in linking citizen science and policy and present a set of recommendations for promoting the better integration of citizen science in the different phases of the policy cycle. Central among these are clarifying policy needs, facilitating access to citizen science data, and improving their evaluation and recognition by decision-makers.</p>\r\n","image1":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-03-24_030303034747_624_Captura%20de%20pantalla%20de%202020-03-24%2004-21-37.png","image2":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-03-24_030303034747_953_Captura%20de%20pantalla%20de%202020-03-24%2004-22-06.png","authors":[{"id":8,"author":"Fermin Serrano"},{"id":11,"author":"Francisco Sanz"},{"id":18,"author":"Maite Pelacho"},{"id":29,"author":"Anne Turbé"},{"id":30,"author":"Jorge Barba"},{"id":31,"author":"Chrisa Tsinaraki"},{"id":32,"author":"Shailendra Mudgal"},{"id":33,"author":"Lucy D.

Citizen science is a quickly evolving field that is mobilizing people’s involvement in information development, social action and justice, and large-scale information gathering. Currently, a wide variety of terms and expressions are being used to refer to the concept of ‘citizen science’ and its practitioners. Here, we explore these terms to help provide guidance for the future growth of this field. We do this by reviewing the theoretical, historical, geopolitical, and disciplinary context of citizen science terminology; discussing what citizen science is and reviewing related terms; and providing a collection of potential terms and definitions for ‘citizen science’ and people participating in citizen science projects. This collection of terms was generated primarily from the broad knowledge base and on-the-ground experience of the authors, by recognizing the potential issues associated with various terms. While our examples may not be systematic or exhaustive, they are intended to be suggestive and invitational of future consideration. In our collective experience with citizen science projects, no single term is appropriate for all contexts. In a given citizen science project, we suggest that terms should be chosen carefully and their usage explained; direct communication with participants about how terminology affects them and what they would prefer to be called also should occur. We further recommend that a more systematic study of terminology trends in citizen science be conducted.","image1":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-03-25_020203035555_473_cb7ed2d3-833f-4b0d-b79b-32206d4f03b2.png","image2":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-03-25_020203035555_560_cb7ed2d3-833f-4b0d-b79b-32206d4f03b2.png","authors":[{"id":149,"author":"Melissa Eitzel"}],"audience":[{"id":1,"audience":"Researchers & Academics"},{"id":2,"audience":"Educators"}],"dateUploaded":"2020-03-25T14:58:55.475640Z","keywords":[{"id":64,"keyword":"crowdsourcing"},{"id":65,"keyword":"community-based participatory research"},{"id":66,"keyword":"epistemology"},{"id":67,"keyword":"public participation in science and research"},{"id":68,"keyword":"ontology"},{"id":69,"keyword":"participatory action research"}],"category":{"id":6,"text":"Moving Image (Video)","parent":null},"license":"https://www.ubiquitypress.com/","publisher":"Citizen Science: Theory and Practice","datePublished":2017,"theme":[{"id":1,"theme":"Introduction to CS"},{"id":2,"theme":"Best practices"},{"id":7,"theme":"Communication"}],"inLanguage":"en","resourceDOI":"http://doi.org/10.5334/cstp.96","featured":false},{"id":61,"name":"Citizen science and global biodiversity","url":"https://www.open.edu/openlearn/science-maths-technology/citizen-science-and-global-biodiversity/content-section-overview","abstract":"\"This free course, Citizen science and global biodiversity, deals with the importance of biodiversity and explores how anyone can contribute to and be involved in identifying and recording wildlife, as a citizen scientist.

Involving the public in research empowers people with lived experience and improves the quality and impact of research (Staley, 2009). Providing a &lsquo;How to&rsquo; guide for Patient &amp; Public Involvement and Engagement (PPIE) is relevant to aligning the mission of the Ludwig Boltzmann Gesellschaft (LBG) to conduct more patient-centered research in the medical field and more inclusive research in social sciences and the humanities that addresses societal needs. The LBG therefore co-created this document for conducting research based on PPIE principles including various perspectives from all involved stakeholders to serve as a central entry point for research based on PPIE principles. In this document, you will find a detailed description about what PPIE stands for, why it is necessary to get involved, and how we co-created this &lsquo;How to&rsquo; guide (Chapter 1). In Chapter 2, you will find the main outcomes from all co-creation workshops regarding PPIE principles. This includes patient and public interaction, relevant governance structures (including budget and project oversight) and the organizational framework that facilitates PPIE activities. In chapter 3, we provide self-assessment checklists and present self-assessment PPIE tools. Chapter 4 covers suggestions on how to monitor and assess PPIE activities, followed by additional resources such as key papers, databases or other important guides (Chapter 5). The target audience for this &lsquo;How to&rsquo; guide is people working in research. Therefore, please read this guide through the &ldquo;researchers&rsquo; lens,&rdquo; as it is intended to be a manual that will ultimately help and support research projects in applying PPIE principles. Please remember this perspective when browsing through the document. Be aware that PPIE research projects all started from scratch and took a step-by-step approach. You do not have to change the world - in your case, your research - overnight. Start by introducing minor changes in your scientific workflow depending on your level of PPIE activities. We are convinced that every small step towards more patient/public involvement will lead to better outcomes. We hope this guide supports you in developing meaningful PPIE into your projects, and we are happy to receive feedback and hear about your experiences applying PPIE principles in your own research.</p>\r\n","image1":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-07-15_080807072929_732_PPIE%20Guide.PNG","image2":null,"authors":[{"id":2051,"author":"R Kaisler"},{"id":2052,"author":"B Missbach"}],"audience":[{"id":1,"audience":"Researchers & Academics"}],"dateUploaded":"2020-07-15T08:18:29.177163Z","keywords":[{"id":21,"keyword":"Engagement"}],"category":{"id":2,"text":"Dataset","parent":null},"license":"CC-BY","publisher":"Ludwig Boltzmann Gesellschaft","datePublished":2019,"theme":[{"id":2,"theme":"Best practices"},{"id":5,"theme":"Engagement"},{"id":6,"theme":"Co-creation"}],"inLanguage":"en","resourceDOI":"http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3515811","featured":false},{"id":81,"name":"Join in: Engagement opportunities","url":"http://gonano-project.eu/category/uncategorized/public-engagement-database/","abstract":"The EU-funded GoNano project enables co-creation between citizens, researchers, industry, civil society organisations and policy makers across Europe to align future nanotechnologies with societal needs and concerns.

The first edition of the BioBlitz was organized in 2018, and the second edition was held on May 25 2019. After a short introduction on sampling techniques and insect ecology, citizens were invited to collect insects at the bank of the pond, in the meadow, and in other locations of the park. This participatory event aimed at raising citizens awareness about biodiversity in the city. The material to be used for the observation and identification of the specimens were provided by the Museum staff.","image1":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-04-17_030304040808_276_affiche-justinei-2019.jpg","image2":null,"authors":[{"id":1,"author":"The Conservation Volunteers"},{"id":238,"author":" C Nold"},{"id":239,"author":" D Dörler"},{"id":240,"author":" Daniel"},{"id":241,"author":" D Fraisl"},{"id":242,"author":" D Riemenschneider"},{"id":243,"author":" F Heigl"},{"id":244,"author":" Florian"},{"id":245,"author":" F Brounéus"},{"id":246,"author":" G Hager"},{"id":247,"author":" K Heuer"},{"id":248,"author":" K Wagenknecht"},{"id":249,"author":" K Vohland"},{"id":250,"author":" L Shanley"},{"id":251,"author":" L Deveaux"},{"id":252,"author":" Lionel"},{"id":253,"author":" L Ceccaroni"},{"id":254,"author":" M Weißpflug"},{"id":255,"author":" M Gold"},{"id":256,"author":" M Mazzonetto"},{"id":257,"author":" M Mačiulienė"},{"id":258,"author":" S Woods"},{"id":259,"author":" S Luna"},{"id":260,"author":" S Hecker"},{"id":261,"author":" T Schaefer"},{"id":262,"author":" T Woods"},{"id":263,"author":" U Wehn"},{"id":311,"author":" J Tweddle"},{"id":312,"author":" L Robinson"},{"id":313,"author":" H Roy"},{"id":314,"author":" M Pocock"},{"id":315,"author":" Vincia Holloman"},{"id":316,"author":" iNaturalist"},{"id":317,"author":" Fermin Serrano"},{"id":318,"author":" Jesús Clemente"},{"id":319,"author":" Mari Carmen Ibañez"},{"id":320,"author":" Francisco Sanz"},{"id":321,"author":" Alfonso Tarancón"},{"id":322,"author":" Laude Guardia"},{"id":323,"author":" David Iñiguez"},{"id":324,"author":" Alejandro Rivero"},{"id":325,"author":" Gonzalo Ruiz"},{"id":326,"author":" Alfredo Ferrer"},{"id":327,"author":" Maite Pelacho"},{"id":328,"author":" Pilar Perla"},{"id":329,"author":" Socientize project"},{"id":330,"author":" Lucía García Sánchez"},{"id":331,"author":" Alejandro Sánchez de Miguel"},{"id":332,"author":" María Diez Ojeda"},{"id":333,"author":" Ayla Márcia Cordeiro Bizerra"},{"id":334,"author":" Miguel Ángel Queiruga Dios"},{"id":335,"author":" Daniel Bruno Collados"},{"id":336,"author":" Mari Carmen Ibáñez Hernández"},{"id":337,"author":" Daniel Lisbona Rubira"},{"id":338,"author":" Anne Turbé"},{"id":339,"author":" Jorge Barba"},{"id":340,"author":" Chrisa Tsinaraki"},{"id":341,"author":" Shailendra Mudgal"},{"id":342,"author":" Lucy D.

While most citizen science projects take place within problem-focused natural sciences, social sciences and humanities help understanding the human dimension and open a broad methodological spectrum for enriching scientific research with new approaches and for boosting public participation. In this paper, we use a meta-synthesis approach to explore how citizen science is practised in the so far less addressed social sciences and humanities by focusing on the role of the citizens, the goals and approaches of the projects, the tasks in which citizens are engaged and their gains across projects of diverse disciplinary background. Our findings indicate that social sciences are gaining more acknowledgment within interdisciplinary citizen science projects by addressing ‘wicked’ problems of human behaviour and agency, while humanities are in quest of a better-defined locus in citizen science. We conclude that social sciences and humanities still face considerable barriers to infiltrate citizen science; the payoffs are substantial and already rewarding for several subfields in social sciences and humanities.","image1":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-05-22_090905052121_492_AnVkAhOV_400x400.jpg","image2":null,"authors":[],"audience":[{"id":7,"audience":"ALL Audiences"}],"dateUploaded":"2020-05-22T09:44:21.343759Z","keywords":[],"category":{"id":6,"text":"Moving Image (Video)","parent":null},"license":"Open Access.

While primarily targeted at CS, the EU-Citizen. Science platform can also support OS. One of its key functions is to act as a knowledge hub to aggregate, disseminate and promote experience and know-how; for example, by profiling CS projects and collecting tools, resources and training materials relevant to both fields. To do this, the platform has developed an information architecture that incorporates the public participation in scientific research (PPSR)&mdash;Common Conceptual Model. This model consists of the Project Metadata Model, the Dataset Metadata Model and the Observation Data Model, which were specifically developed for CS initiatives. By implementing these, the platform will strengthen the interoperating arrangements that exist between other, similar platforms (e.g., BioCollect and SciStarter) to ensure that CS and OS continue to grow globally in terms of participants, impact and fields of application.</p>\r\n","image1":null,"image2":null,"authors":[{"id":285,"author":"L Ceccaroni"}],"audience":[{"id":1,"audience":"Researchers & Academics"}],"dateUploaded":"2021-02-10T14:34:11.790378Z","keywords":[{"id":11,"keyword":"Metadata"}],"category":{"id":17,"text":"Scientific Publication","parent":12},"license":"","publisher":"","datePublished":null,"theme":[{"id":11,"theme":"Data quality and standards"}],"inLanguage":"en","resourceDOI":"10.1162/dint_a_00085","featured":false},{"id":150,"name":"Citizen Science Portalen","url":"https://citizenscience.dk","abstract":"<p>Citizen Science Portalen (<a href=\"http://www.citizenscience.dk\" target=\"_blank\">www.citizenscience.dk</a>) is the online platform for the <a href=\"https://citizenscience.dk/mission-og-vaerdier\" target=\"_blank\">Danish Citizen Science Network</a>.

In other words, the project seeks to understand the impact of Citizen Science on Spanish scientific culture. To this end, the Observatory has identified a significant number of actors (research groups, funding programmes, citizens&#39; initiatives, physical spaces, NGOs...), analysed the main trends and good practices, and collected tools for the long-term monitoring of citizen science in Spain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its impacts are both scientific and social, political and educational. The use of citizen science and its study can be found in publications, with a growing evolution around several disciplines, especially the monitoring of biodiversity and the environment. But the impact of science is also felt in practice outside of academia, including on social networks. To a certain extent, the Observatory of Citizen Science in Spain has served to promote and foster coordination between citizen science in our country. We have developed face-to-face events with more than 100 cases between workshops and presentations, including citizen scientists.

Die M&ouml;glichkeiten der Forschungsbeteiligung sind nicht neu, zahlreiche Ehrenamtliche haben schon immer ihre Umwelt erforscht und zur Vermehrung von Wissen beigetragen. Was neu ist, sind zahlreiche M&ouml;glichkeiten der Teilhabe (als sozialpolitisches Konzept f&uuml;r Selbstbestimmung und Eigenverantwortung), der Teilnahme (als eine Form des Mitmachens) und der Teilgabe (verstanden als das Teilen und Zug&auml;nglichmachen von Wissen) durch die Entwicklung und breite Anwendung von modernen Internet-Technologien. Unterst&uuml;tzt werden diese Entwicklungen auch durch die Bereitschaft und Erkenntnis der Forschenden, ihre Forschung st&auml;rker an den gesellschaftlichen Bed&uuml;rfnissen auszurichten, und die Akteure der Gesellschaft fr&uuml;hzeitig in Forschungsprozesse einzubinden. Vom 11. bis 12. M&auml;rz 2020 hat die Veranstaltung &quot;Citizen Science - Neues Beteiligungsformat f&uuml;r die Forschung zur Agrar-, Forst-, Fischereiwirtschaft und zu l&auml;ndlichen R&auml;umen&quot; mit mehr als 30 Teilnehmenden aus dem Th&uuml;nen-Institut und aus Partner-Organisationen stattgefunden. An Beispielen aus der Agrar-, Forst- und Fischereiwirtschaft und zu den l&auml;ndlichen R&auml;umen wurden M&ouml;glichkeiten diskutiert, wie Citizen Science (CS) in die eigene Forschung integriert werden kann/k&ouml;nnte. Citizen Science hat ein gro&szlig;es Potential f&uuml;r die Themenfelder, die seitens des Th&uuml;nen-Instituts bearbeitet werden, wobei insbesondere an die Erfahrungen und Erkenntnisse der sozialwissenschaftlichen Forschung am Th&uuml;nen-Institut anzukn&uuml;pfen ist. Citizen Science kann eine erg&auml;nzende Perspektive als Teilfrage f&uuml;r wissenschaftliche Projekte bieten, um den Wissenstransfer und den Wissensaustausch zwischen Forschenden und Akteuren der Gesellschaft und Politik zu erm&ouml;glichen. F&uuml;r die weitere F&ouml;rderung der Integration des Ansatzes in bestehende und zuk&uuml;nftige Forschungst&auml;tigkeiten und -vorhaben gilt es, Kapazit&auml;ten f&uuml;r Citizen Science zu entwickeln und auszubauen. Hierzu sollen unter anderen weiteren Veranstaltungen zum Thema Citizen Science stattfinden, die sich z.B. mit der Sicherung von Datenqualit&auml;t und Ehrenamtsmanagement besch&auml;ftigen.

Citizen science projects have been remarkably successful in advancing scientific knowledge, and contributions from citizen scientists now provide a vast quantity of data about species occurrence and distribution around the world. Most citizen science projects also strive to help participants learn about the organisms they are observing and to experience the process by which scientific investigations are conducted. Developing and implementing public data-collection projects that yield both scientific and educational outcomes requires significant effort. This article describes the model for building and operating citizen science projects that has evolved at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology over the past two decades. We hope that our model will inform the fields of biodiversity monitoring, biological research, and science education while providing a window into the culture of citizen science.","image1":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-03-25_111103035252_549_m_bio.2009.59.11.9-t01.gif","image2":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-03-25_111103035252_345_m_bio.2009.59.11.9-t01.gif","authors":[{"id":57,"author":"Rick Bonney"},{"id":90,"author":"Caren B.

We describe the two interwoven paths by which citizen science can improve conservation efforts, natural resource management, and environmental protection. The first path includes building scientific knowledge, while the other path involves informing policy and encouraging public action.

It  covers  the  spectrum  of research approaches and offers different methods for  engaging  volunteers  with  research  in  a  variety  of  ways.  Common  to  every  citizen  science  project  is  a  need to communicate with the public effectively. This to  recruit  and  retain  citizen  scientists,  but  equally  to  inform,  train  and  thank  them,  in  the  proper  manner,  when the project ends. It  was  this  need  which  prompted  Scivil,  the  Flemish  Knowledge  Centre  for  Citizen  Science,  to  set  up  the  working  group  on  communication  and  participation.  The working group decided to document its communication expertise in this guide for anyone who plans to initiate a citizen science project.In  June  2019  the  working  group  surveyed  the  initiators of citizen science projects in Flanders. We asked them  what  their  projects  already  had  in  the  way  of  communication  expertise,  and  in  which  areas  they  were still short of knowledge.The results taught us that most projects do well when it  comes  to  recruiting  citizen  scientists  (‘ordinary’  people  with  no  prior  knowledge  of  the  subject,  who  volunteer  for  citizen  science  projects).  But  the  challenge, it seems, is to retain them over a longer period of  time.  Nor  is  it  always  a  straightforward  matter  to  engage the right, or more diverse, target audiences.In  this  guide  we  provide  the  building  blocks  to  write  up a communication plan for your project, and we include  exercises  on  how  to  identify  a  target  audience  and reach out to schools. We also offer a set of tactics and tools, to secure the initial and continued participation of your citizen scientists.  Finally,  with  our  practical  tips,  you  can  be-gin  the  job  of  defining  your  communication  plan  and  choosing  the  right  tactics  for  effective  communication in citizen science. This  guide  is  for  anyone  who  finds  themselves  communicating  and  engaging  with  citizen  scientists.  The  content  of  the  guide  is  based  on  studies  of  citizen  participation  and  the  real-life  experience  of  science  communicators.

Following the initiative of the platform Österreich forscht, many of the institutions that are active in citizen science joined forces in the Citizen Science Network Austria in 2017, and thus agreed to advance the quality of citizen science in Austria (http://www.citizen-science.at/the-platform/the-network). An important step in this regard was the establishment of transparent criteria for projects wishing to be listed on the platform Österreich forscht. The objective of these criteria is to maintain and further improve the quality of the projects presented on the platform. Between March 2017 and February 2018, a working group of the platform Österreich forscht consisting of representatives from 17 institutions developed criteria that allow for the transparent evaluation of projects applying to be listed on Österreich forscht. This was a multi-stage process, building both on the knowledge of the working group members as well as on feedback repeatedly provided by external experts from the respective research fields. Throughout October 2017, a version of the quality criteria was available for public online consultation on the platform Österreich forscht, so as to incorporate the knowledge of the general public into the criteria as well. The final version of the quality criteria was presented at the 4th Austrian Citizen Science Conference, 1-3 February 2018, at which point the criteria also came into effect. Projects already listed on Österreich forscht can adapt to meet the criteria over the next year. Projects wishing to be newly listed on Österreich forscht must meet these criteria at the point of listing. Where necessary, the quality criteria will be adapted in the future, in order to respond to new challenges and developments. The version number, i.e. which version of the criteria a project corresponds to, will be indicated on the respective project page. The first part of the criteria is primarily aimed at establishing what defines a citizen science project. Here, we decided on a negative list (i.e. projects that are NOT citizen science), in order to be as open as possible to different concepts and disciplines. This implies that we call all projects citizen science, which are not excluded by this negative list. The professional background of the person leading the project is not crucial as long as the criteria are complied by the project. The criteria in the second part are to be understood as minimum standards which all projects listed on the platform Österreich forscht must fulfill. The evaluation will be carried out by the coordinators of the platform Österreich forscht in consultation with working group members.","image1":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-03-26_121203033535_932_ee760d1c1474fde7f8f71a96b2452e29_L.jpg","image2":null,"authors":[{"id":89,"author":"David Ziegler"},{"id":98,"author":"Steffen Fritz"},{"id":114,"author":"Gerid Hager"},{"id":207,"author":"Pamela Bartar"},{"id":208,"author":"Robert Brodschneider"},{"id":209,"author":"Marika Cieslinski"},{"id":210,"author":"Marlene Ernst"},{"id":211,"author":"Irmgard Krisai - Greilhuber"},{"id":212,"author":"Jennifer Hatlauf"},{"id":213,"author":"Susanne  Hecker"},{"id":214,"author":"Thomas Hübner"},{"id":215,"author":"Barbara Kieslinger"},{"id":216,"author":"Peter Kraker"},{"id":217,"author":"Thomas Krennert"},{"id":218,"author":"Gerit  Oberraufner"},{"id":219,"author":"Katharina T.

Het is een spectrum van onderzoeksaanpakken\r\nuit alle onderzoeksdisciplines met diverse methodes om de burger op verschillende manieren te betrekken\r\nbij onderzoek. Wat alle burgerwetenschapsprojectengemeen hebben, is een nood aan goede communicatie. Communicatie om burgerwetenschappers te rekruteren en te behouden, maar ook om hen te\r\ninformeren, op te leiden of om hen na afloop van het project op de juiste manier te bedanken. \r\n\r\nDaarom startte Scivil, het expertisecentrum citizen science Vlaanderen, een werkgroep communicatie en participatie op. De werkgroep besliste om zijn communicatie-expertise te bundelen in deze gids voor initiatiefnemers van burgerwetenschapsprojecten. In juni 2019 organiseerde de werkgroep een bevraging\r\nbij initiatiefnemers van burgerwetenschapsprojecten in Vlaanderen. We vroegen hen naar de communicatie-expertise die al aanwezig was in de projecten en naar welke kennis ze nog op zoek waren. De resultaten tonen aan dat de meeste projecten er goed in slagen om burgerwetenschappers (‘gewone’ mensen zonder voorkennis die actief deelnemen aan burgerwetenschapsprojecten) te rekruteren. Het blijkt een grotere uitdaging om hen op langere termijn betrokken te houden. Ook de juiste of meer diverse\r\ndoelgroepen bereiken ligt niet altijd voor de hand. \r\n\r\nIn deze gids reiken we de bouwstenen aan om een communicatieplan voor je project op te stellen, met\r\ninbegrip van een oefening over doelgroepbepaling en het bereiken van scholen.  Daarnaast stellen we een\r\naantal tactieken en tools voor om initiële en continue participatie te bevorderen. Tot slot kun je zelf aan de\r\nslag met praktische tips: bepaal jouw communicatieplan en tactieken voor een goede communicatie bij\r\nburgerwetenschap. \r\n\r\nDeze gids dient als hulpmiddel voor iedereen die betrokken is bij de communicatie met en het engageren\r\nvan burgerwetenschappers. De inhoud van de gids is gebaseerd op onderzoek naar burgerparticipatie\r\nen op ervaring van wetenschapscommunicatoren. Gebruik deze gids als een bron van inspiratie en haal\r\ner die ideeën uit die bij jouw noden passen.  Vergeet vooral niet om in de eerste plaats je eigen enthousiasme uit te dragen!","image1":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-04-14_090904041111_852_cover.png","image2":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-04-14_090904041111_914_inhoud.png","authors":[],"audience":[{"id":6,"audience":"Policy & Decision Makers"},{"id":2,"audience":"Educators"},{"id":1,"audience":"Researchers & Academics"},{"id":5,"audience":"CSOs & NGOs"},{"id":4,"audience":"CS Project Leaders & Initiators"}],"dateUploaded":"2020-04-14T09:15:12.087698Z","keywords":[],"category":{"id":15,"text":"Guideline","parent":12},"license":"All rights reserved.","publisher":"Scivil","datePublished":2019,"theme":[{"id":2,"theme":"Best practices"},{"id":5,"theme":"Engagement"},{"id":7,"theme":"Communication"}],"inLanguage":"nl","resourceDOI":"ISBN: 9789463965606","featured":false},{"id":80,"name":"Joining the debate on nanotechnologies- A citizens guide","url":"http://gonano-project.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/guide_citizens-how-to_04.pdf","abstract":"GoNano developed a \"How- to\" guide to support citizens who would like to engage with nanotechnologies to express their own needs and concerns and ensure that their thoughts are taken into account in future developments.

Citizen science goals include enhancing scientific knowledge generation, contributing to societally relevant questions, fostering scientific literacy in society and transforming science communication. These aims, however, are rarely evaluated, and project managers as well as prospective funders are often at a loss when it comes to assessing and reviewing the quality and impact of citizen science activities. To ensure and improve the quality of citizen science outcomes evaluation methods are required for planning, self-evaluation and training development as well as for informing funding reviews and impact assessments. Here, based on an in-depth review of the characteristics and diversity of citizen science activities and current evaluation practices, we develop an open framework for evaluating diverse citizen science activities, ranging from projects initiated by grassroots initiatives to those led by academic scientists.  The framework incorporates the social, the scientific and the socio-ecological/economic perspectives of citizen science and thus offers a comprehensive collection of indicators at a glance. Indicators on a process- and impact-level can be selected and prioritized from all three perspectives, according to the specific contexts and targets. The framework guides and fosters the critical assessment and enhancement of citizen science projects against these goals both for external funding reviews as well as for internal project development.","image1":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-09-09_111109093737_76_Screenshot%202020-09-09%20at%2013.16.31.png","image2":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2020-09-09_111109093737_787_Screenshot%202020-09-09%20at%2013.16.31.png","authors":[{"id":268,"author":"B Kieslinger"},{"id":271,"author":"D Dörler"},{"id":275,"author":"F Heigl"},{"id":293,"author":"T Schaefer"},{"id":309,"author":"A Richter"},{"id":310,"author":"A Bonn"}],"audience":[{"id":6,"audience":"Policy & Decision Makers"},{"id":4,"audience":"CS Project Leaders & Initiators"},{"id":1,"audience":"Researchers & Academics"}],"dateUploaded":"2020-05-25T13:47:27.038392Z","keywords":[{"id":5,"keyword":"Evaluation"}],"category":{"id":17,"text":"Scientific Publication","parent":12},"license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","publisher":"Zenodo","datePublished":2017,"theme":[{"id":16,"theme":"Evaluation of citizen science"}],"inLanguage":"en","resourceDOI":"10.31235/osf.io/enzc9","featured":false},{"id":90,"name":"Training needs and recommendations for Citizen Science participants, facilitators and designers","url":"https://nhm.openrepository.com/handle/10141/622589","abstract":"In this report, we aimed to systematise and elaborate on the ideas discussed during the COST Action WG2 workshop “Systematic review on training requirements and recommendations for Citizen Science” that took place in Riga on 12-13th November 2018.

We then addressed the needs by formulating recommendations and pointing out available resources that have been proven to be useful in our own citizen science research and practice. While we acknowledge that these training needs and training recommendations may not be complete, we believe that our approach from needs to recommendations can act as a helpful working model when designing training and the list of resources provides a starting point to delve deeper into the topic and good training examples to build on.

It is responsible for more than 400,000 premature deaths in Europe each year and considerably damages human health, agriculture, and the natural environment. Despite these facts, the readiness and power of citizens to take actions is limited. To address this challenge, the citizen science project CAPTOR was launched in 2016. Using low-cost measurement devices, citizens in three European testbeds supported the monitoring of tropospheric ozone. This paper presents the results from 53 interviews with involved residents and shows that the active involvement of individuals in a complex process such as measuring tropospheric ozone can have important impacts on their knowledge and attitudes. In an attempt to expand the benefits of low-cost air quality sensors from an individual to a regional level, certain preconditions are key. Strong support in assuring data quality, visibility of the collected data in online and offline media, broad dissemination of results, and intensified communication with political decision-makers are needed.</p>\r\n","image1":"https://eu-citizen.science/media/media/images/2021-02-09_121202020000_230_cstp-5-1-245-g1.png","image2":null,"authors":[{"id":215,"author":"Barbara Kieslinger"},{"id":2004,"author":"Teresa Schaefer"},{"id":2005,"author":"Claudia Magdalena Fabian"}],"audience":[{"id":6,"audience":"Policy & Decision Makers"},{"id":5,"audience":"CSOs & NGOs"},{"id":4,"audience":"CS Project Leaders & Initiators"},{"id":1,"audience":"Researchers & Academics"}],"dateUploaded":"2021-02-09T12:42:00.309645Z","keywords":[{"id":5,"keyword":"Evaluation"},{"id":25,"keyword":"air quality"},{"id":93,"keyword":"impact"}],"category":{"id":17,"text":"Scientific Publication","parent":12},"license":"","publisher":"Citizen Science: Theory and Practice","datePublished":2020,"theme":[{"id":15,"theme":"Impact"},{"id":16,"theme":"Evaluation of citizen science"}],"inLanguage":"en","resourceDOI":"http://doi.org/10.5334/cstp.245","featured":false},{"id":167,"name":"Citizen Science SDG Conference","url":"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeTlYFAGADkOHH3DyfkBkfGEmJzfDDpIp","abstract":"<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In October 2020, the Museum f&uuml;r Naturkunde Berlin (MfN)&nbsp;with many partners, supported by the European Commission and the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), held an international, hybrid conference in order to showcase, evaluate, and discuss the contribution of citizen science to frame and achieve the SDGs.
